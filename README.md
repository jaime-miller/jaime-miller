## Bio for GitHub

With over 20 years of experience in the call center industry, I have honed my expertise in quality assurance, training, compliance, and leadership roles. My extensive background has equipped me with a deep understanding of call center operations and a passion for enhancing performance and customer satisfaction.

As I transition into the Business Intelligence and Data Analysis field, I aim to leverage my experience to provide actionable insights that drive call center performance improvements. By utilizing data analytics, I seek to identify trends, optimize processes, and deliver strategies that elevate customer experiences and operational efficiency.

In 2024, I enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program. The curriculum covered business analytics, advanced spreadsheets in Excel, data visualization (Tableau), Power BI, SQL, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects.

## About Me

Hello! I'm Jaime Miller. I love being in the sun and spending time outdoors. I live with my partner and our four cats. In my free time, I enjoy playing games on my phone or iPad and watching murder mysteries and cooking competition TV shows.
