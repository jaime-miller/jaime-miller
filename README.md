## Bio for GitHub

With over 20 years of experience in the call center industry, I have honed my expertise in quality assurance, training, compliance, and leadership roles. My extensive background has equipped me with a deep understanding of call center operations and a passion for enhancing performance and customer satisfaction.

As I transition into the Business Intelligence and Data Analysis field, I aim to leverage my experience to provide actionable insights that drive call center performance improvements. By utilizing data analytics, I seek to identify trends, optimize processes, and deliver strategies that elevate customer experiences and operational efficiency.

In 2024, I completed the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program. The curriculum covered business analytics, advanced spreadsheets in Excel, data visualization (Tableau), Power BI, SQL, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects.

I am currently working on the Career Acceleration Program as well as a project in basic Python!
